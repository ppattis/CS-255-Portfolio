### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.  Who was the client?  What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a company that provides drivers education training.  The owner noticed that there was a severe lack of training available for students to learn driving skills.  The client wants a web based system that would allow for scheduling driving lessons, taking practice exams, and store all information related to the running of the training facility.

### What did you do particularly well?

I think that I did a pretty good job of capturing the requirements of the system the client wanted out of their system.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick?  How would you improve it?



### How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design?  Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

I take the user's requirements one by one, and break them down into functional actions that need to be accomplished to complete the requirement.  If a system designer doesn't consider a user's needs when designing a system, then the system will be mostly useless.  No one will buy a system that doesn't fullfill a need for them, and if no one will buy a system as designed, then unless the system was designed for the designer alone, it is mostly a waste of time to design.

### How do you approach designing software?  What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software in a rather iterative manner.  I will start with a broad concept, like "I want a system for training.".  From that point I will continually iterate through the design and narrow in on the requirements.  Keep adding and refining the design until each requirement is accounted for in as atomic a level as possible.
